"""Abstract base class for checkpoint loading strategies.

Loading strategies are responsible for applying checkpoint data to a
model. Different strategies handle different use cases: warm start
(resume training), cold start (fresh optimiser), transfer learning
(partial weight loading), and weights-only loading.

Example
-------
>>> class WeightsOnlyLoader(LoadingStrategy):
...     async def process(self, context: CheckpointContext) -> CheckpointContext:
...         state_dict = self._extract_state_dict(context)
...         context.model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
...         self._mark_weights_loaded(context.model)
...         return context

class LoadingStrategy(PipelineStage):
    """Abstract base class for all checkpoint loading strategies.

    Loading strategies form the orchestration layer of the checkpoint
    pipeline. They receive a context with loaded checkpoint data and
    apply it to the model (and optionally optimiser/scheduler) according
    to a specific strategy.

    Subclasses must implement the ``process`` method. Several convenience
    methods are provided for common operations:

    - ``_extract_state_dict``: Extract model state dict from checkpoint data
    - ``_preserve_anemoi_metadata``: Preserve Anemoi-specific model metadata
    - ``_mark_weights_loaded``: Flag the model as having loaded weights

    Examples
    --------
    >>> class TransferLearningLoader(LoadingStrategy):
    ...     async def process(self, context: CheckpointContext) -> CheckpointContext:
    ...         state_dict = self._extract_state_dict(context)
    ...         # ... filter and apply compatible weights ...
    ...         self._preserve_anemoi_metadata(context.model, context.checkpoint_data)
    ...         self._mark_weights_loaded(context.model)

        Implementations should:
        1. Validate that required context fields are present

        2. Extract the state dict from checkpoint data
        3. Apply weights to the model according to the strategy
        4. Optionally restore optimiser/scheduler state
        5. Preserve Anemoi metadata and mark weights as loaded
        6. Update context metadata with loading results

        Parameters
        ----------
        context : CheckpointContext
            Pipeline context with ``checkpoint_data`` populated by
            a prior source stage and ``model`` set to the target model.

        Returns
        -------
        CheckpointContext
            Context with model weights applied and metadata updated.

        Raises
        ------
        CheckpointLoadError
            If weights cannot be loaded into the model
        CheckpointIncompatibleError
